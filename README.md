The PM2511 packages repository contains recipes for building ipkgs for the
PM2511.

In order to build packages for the PM2511, you will need a Virtual Machine
(VM) with the bitbake and OpenEmbedded build components. You can obtain an
appropriate VM from your application support representative.

Once you have a VM, follow the instructions on the [Building packages
page](https://github.com/dustcloud/pm2511-packages/wiki/Building-packages).
